-- Config Information --

-----
NOTE - When I say "true" or "false" in double quotes like this, in the terms of the config.json file it means true / false without double quotation marks.
        - Ex: "enabled": "true"    <-- IS WRONG, it's     "enabled": true

-- Text Chat Messages --

If you want the R6 AFK Bot to type messages in the in-game chat for you, then do the following:
- Set the variable "enabled" under the category, "Text_Chat_Messages" to true (false to turn it back off)
- Set the variable "all_chat_key" under the category, "Text_Chat_Messages" to your all chat key, the default is "t"
- Set the variable "num_of_messages" under the category, "Text_Chat_Messages" to the number of messages you want the bot to send when it's time to send messages

SIDE NOTE(s):
--- If the interval between messages is too slow for you, then do this:
        - Edit the variable "message_interval" under the category, "Advanced" like this: 
            - The variable should be in the form of [x1, x2]; x1 will be the minimum time in minutes between each message, while x2 is the maximum time in minutes.

--- If you want to use your own custom messages, or use a wider variety of "positive" messages, then do this:     (these messages don't guarantee positive units)
    - Set the variable "limit_messages" under the category, "Advanced" to false (true to turn it back off)
    
    - FOR CUSTOM MESSAGES (ADVANCED USERS ONLY):
        - You'll need to compile from source, and edit the file called "assets/messages.txt" with each line containing each message you want the R6 AFK Bot to send.

-- Mode Selection -- 

If you want to queue for a specific mode, and not ONLY queue for your last played gamemode (the gamemode that says "play again"), then do the following:
- Set the variable "enabled" under the category, "Mode_Selection" to true (false to turn it back off)
- Set the variable "gamemode" under the category, "Mode_Selection" to one of the following (these aren't case sensitive):
    - "Ranked" for the gamemode Ranked
    - "Unranked" for the gamemode Unranked
    - "Casual" for the gamemode Quick Match
    - "Random" to randomly queue for one of the gamemodes (If you have "enabled" set to true, but have an invalid gamemode, then by default, it randomly queues)
